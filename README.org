* What Is It

=Orga= is a flexible org-mode syntax parser. It parses org content into an AST ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree][Abstract Syntax Tree ðŸŒ²]]). And it's written in JavaScript.

* Why
org-mode is simply a superior format than other more popular ones, but it's mostly trapped inside of emacs. It's so good that it was the #1 reason to learn and use emacs for a lot of people (me included). But it's too good to not share with the rest of the world. If it can run in JavaScript, it can run on anything.

* Compatible Ecosystems
** [[https://unifiedjs.com][Unified]]

The =orga= parser is compliant with the [[https://unifiedjs.com/][unified]] spec, any output can be piped into another function that supports a unified AST as an input.

** Webpack
=@orgajs/loader= is Orga's [[https://webpack.js.org][Webpack]] component.

** React
[[https://reactjs.org/][React]] components can be directly rendered in your org files.
