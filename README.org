org-mode with JavaScript
#+END_QUOTE

* What Is It

=Orga= is a flexible org-mode syntax parser. It parses org content into AST ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree][Abstract Syntax Tree üå≤]]), then what you can do with it is limited only by your imagination.

* Why

The reason why markdown is so popular is that org-mode is kind of trapped inside of emacs (I am joking, sort of. üòâ). I want to share the awesomeness with the rest of the world. JavaScript runs everywhere nowadays, so, why not.

* What You Can Do with it NOW

- Build a full-featured gatsby blog in seconds, customize it progressively, bits by bits. [[https://www.huxiaoxing.com/building-a-website-with-org-mode-files][Here is the post]].
- Build a bare-bone gatsby website (for those of you tinkerers), start building your website from raw data.
- Integrate org-mode into any of your JavaScript projects. E.g. a real-time org-mode -> HTML transformer on your website, like [[https://orga.js.org][this one]].

* What You Can Do Potentially

- emacs-less cli for org-mode
- org-mode desktop app with [[https://www.electronjs.org][electron]], or a [[https://code.visualstudio.com][Visual Studio Code]] extension.
- org-mode mobile app with [[https://reactnative.dev][react native]].

* Compatible Eco-systems

Nobody likes to reinvent wheels more than us programmers. But when you see a pretty solid wheel, it's wise to take advantage of it.

#+END_QUOTE

The =orga= parser is completely compatible with unified. Which means you get to take advantage of the works of others put into the pipeline.

Build blazing fast, modern apps and websites with React
#+END_QUOTE

One of the best static website/app generator out there. Trust me; I have tried a lot. Don't be put off by words like =React= or =JavaScript=. Like it or not, they are taking over the web. orga is deeply integrated with gatsby (via [[file:packages/gatsby-transformer-orga/README.md][plugins]] and [[file:packages/gatsby-theme-blorg/README.md][themes]]) to create the tools for building powerful websites without much hassle. Also, We can leverage other plugins people build for markdown-based websites. Which is a much richer eco-system, now it's ours too.
