* What Is It

=Orga= is a flexible org-mode syntax parser. It parses org content into AST ([[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree][Abstract Syntax Tree üå≤]]). And it's written in JavaScript.

* Why
org-mode is simply a superior format than other more popular ones, but it's mostly trapped inside emacs. It's so good that it even becomes the reason to learn and use emacs for a lot of people (me included). But it's too good to not share with the rest of the world. If it can run in JavaScript, it can run on anything.

* Compatible Eco-systems
It integrates natively with popular tools.
